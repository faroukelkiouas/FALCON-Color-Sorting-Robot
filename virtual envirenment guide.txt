##To install the venv module for Python virtual environments, run this command:

sudo apt-get install python3-venv
##You only need to do this once for all future projects.

##Step 5. Create a new Python project in a virtual environment
##To create a new Python project in a virtual environment, run the following:

cd ~
python3 -m venv hello
##This will create a new folder called hello that you should change to:

cd ~/hello
##List the folder contents:

ls -ls
##You should see a file called pyvenv.cfg.

##Dump the contents of the file to the screen:

cat pyvenv.cfg 
##You should see a result like this (though your version my vary):

home = /usr/bin
include-system-site-packages = false
version = 3.7.3
##This indicates that version 3 of Python will be used.

##The include-system-site-packages = false line indicates that this program will not use any external packages installed elswhere on your system. The idea is to create a program in an isolated environment. That way it can be run on other systems without having to worry about external dependencies.

##Step 6. Activate the virtual enviroment
##Switch to the hello folder and activate the virtual enviromnent:

cd ~/hello
source bin/activate
##Your prompt should change to something like this (your user and hostname may be different):

(hello) pi@pi4:~/hello $
