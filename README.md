Welcome to **FALCON** â€“ a smart and fully functional color-sorting robot equipped with a robotic arm and autonomous movement. It detects colored objects using OpenCV and sorts them precisely using inverse kinematics and servo motors. Built with Raspberry Pi, 3D-printed components, and a passion for automation!

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The camera detects the objectâ€™s color using the HSV color model.
2. If color matches, robot navigates towards the object.
3. Inverse Kinematics calculates joint angles.
4. The robotic arm picks and places the object in the correct colored bin.
5. The robot announces its action with voice feedback.
